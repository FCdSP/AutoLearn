# AutoLearn (ICDM 2017)

This repository contains source code for the research work described in:

[AutoLearn â€” Automated Feature Generation and Selection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8215494)

## Note:
-- The current version of the code is not optimized. I will updated the optimized version in coming weeks.

-- The hyperparameters values of the threshold are hard coded. 

-- Use hyperparameter optimization to get the best results for each classifier.

-- All dataset files should follow the same template as that of sonar.csv (label column at the last)
